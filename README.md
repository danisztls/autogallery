**AutoGallery** is a Pinterest-esque self-contained and static photo gallery that is automagically generated from a shell script and viewed in any browser.

I'm using [sachinchoolur/lightgallery.js](https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lightgallery.js) for the lightbox.

This is a demo. I intend to rewrite it in Python as a fully featured web photo gallery.

## Usage
```shell
./autogallery <path-to-dir-with-pics>
```
